### Libraries and Bindings

[ReScript Package Index](https://rescript-lang.org/packages)
To discover libraries and bindings for ReScript, please use the [official package index tool](https://rescript-lang.org/packages). Libraries with the `rescript` keyword in their `package.json` will appear there, as well as manually added resources. If you happen to find no bindings for a library, please ask for it on the [forum](<(https://forum.rescript-lang.org)>). Chances are that somebody already wrote them, but kept them private, because maintaining a full set of bindings is always harder than tweaking them to one's specific needs.

### Editor Support

(also refer to the [official site](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/editor-plugins))

#### General ReScript language support

- [ReScript-VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode)
- [ReScript-Sublime](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-sublime)
- [VIM-ReScript](https://github.com/rescript-lang/vim-rescript)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/ide-rescript)
- [IDEA](https://github.com/giraud/reasonml-idea-plugin)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reason-mode)

#### Other extensions

- [vscode-rescript-relay](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GabrielNordeborn.vscode-rescript-relay)

#### Snippets in VSCode

The official snippets included with the ReScript-VSCode extension are available [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/blob/master/snippets.json). You don't need to do anything to activate them; the extension already installs them.

But you can also add your snippets if you want to. You can add them as user snippets or in a workspace through a `rescript.code-snippets` file in the `.vscode` folder in the root of your workspace / project. See an example of some user snippets [here](rescript.code-snippets). Read more about snippets in VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).

#### Keybindings in VSCode

If you're coming to ReScript React from other languages, you probably find yourself writing `React.string("")` quite a lot, but maybe sometimes forgetting to add the `React.string` call.

Luckily, VSCode has support for adding custom keybindings. If you open your `keybindings.json` and add the following, you can select any piece of code and press `cmd+k` followed by `s` to add the `React.string` call around the selection:

```
{
  {
    "key": "cmd+k s",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
      "snippet": "{React.string(\"$TM_SELECTED_TEXT\")}"
    }
  }
  ...rest of your keybindings.json
}
```

Change the keybinding to your liking. Read more about keybindings in VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
